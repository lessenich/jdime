## System Requirements:
* At least Java 11 for running the Gradle build of JDime
* Java 8 for developing / running JDime. If you are using Gradle to build / run, Gradle will automatically discover / download Java 8.
* If you are not on 64bit Linux or Windows: [libgit2](https://libgit2.github.com/) (for [JNativeMerge](https://gitlab.infosun.fim.uni-passau.de/seibt/JNativeMerge))

## Installation:
Clone the repository using `git clone $URL`.

JDime uses [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) as its build system.
To avoid version mismatches with already installed instances of gradle, you can use the supplied gradle wrapper `gradlew` that bootstraps the right version of gradle automatically.

After running `./gradlew installDist`, the directory `build/scripts` will contain Unix and Windows scripts that you can use to start the application.

## Usage:
The input versions are passed to JDime as command line arguments. To perform a three-way merge, JDime may be invoked as follows:

`JDime --mode [linebased|semistructured|structured] --output [file/directory] <leftVersion> <baseVersion> <rightVersion>`

**Run `JDime --help` to show more extensive usage information.**
